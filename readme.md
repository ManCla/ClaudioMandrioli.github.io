# Claudio Mandrioli

Hello visitor! This is a work in progress for my personal website :) for now it only contains the preprints to papers I co-authored.


This repository contains the preprints of all the papers I have co-authored.
The pdf of all the papers can be found in the _papers_ directory (also linked from this readme file).
When applicable, also the link to the associated artifacts are provided.
