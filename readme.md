# Welcome!

Hello visitor! This is a work in progress for my personal website :)


I am a Research Associate (post-doc) at the [Software Verification and Validation Lab](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/research/software_verification_and_validation_lab/), headed by [Lionel Briand](https://www.lbriand.info/), University of Luxembourg, since January 2023.

I received my PhD from Lund University, department of [Automatic Control](https://control.lth.se/), working with [Martina Maggio](https://www.martinamaggio.com/main/).
During my PhD I spent six month as visiting student at the [Software Verification and Validation Lab](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/research/software_verification_and_validation_lab/) at the University of Luxembourg working with [Seung Yeob Shin](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/people/seung_yeob_shin), [Domenico Bianculli](https://people.svv.lu/bianculli/) and [Lionel Briand](https://www.lbriand.info/).
I obtained my master and bachelor degrees in Automation and Control Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.deib.polimi.it/eng/home-page), respectively in 2017 and 2015.

## Research Interest

I do research on software engineering for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).
When testing CPS, interdisciplinary considerations are necessary. 
I leverage my background in control engineering to enhance the software engineering techniques applied to such systems.
